``pacwall.sh`` is a shell script that changes your wallpaper to the dependency
graph of installed packages. Each package is a node and each edge indicates a
dependency between two packages. The explicitly installed packages have a
distinct color (orange by default). The packages that are not explicitly
installed and not directly required by any other package ("orphans") have a
distinct color, too (blue by default, *applies only to Arch*). The dependencies
of type *X provides Y* are represented as an edge with an inverted arrow that
points towards *Y* (*applies only to Arch*).

An `AUR package`_ is available.

Wallpaper backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``pacwall`` tries to set the wallpaper using ``feh`` and ``hsetroot``.

-------------------------------
Desktop environment integration
-------------------------------

Use ``-D`` to enable desktop environment integration (KDE Plasma, GNOME, ...).
You will be able to see the generated wallpapers in the graphical wallpaper picker.

DE integration requires ``imagemagick`` and ``xorg-xdpyinfo``
(If you are on Wayland you need to specify the screen size manually like this:
``./pacwall.sh -DS 1920x1200``).

**WARNING**:
Setting a wallpaper in GNOME and the derivatives isn't possible with ``feh`` and ``hsetroot``.
``-D`` is *required*.
(If you don't know your DE, it is probably GNOME)

-----------------
Pywal integration
-----------------

Run ``./pacwall.sh -W`` to use colors set by pywal
(1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 8th color to be exact).

-------------
Customization
-------------

Customizations can be made on the commandline, see the options with
``./pacwall.sh -h``.

.. code-block:: bash

    USAGE: pacwall.sh
            [ -iDW ]
            [ -b BACKGROUND ]
            [ -d NODE_COLOR ]
            [ -e EXPLICIT_NODE_COLOR ]
            [ -p ORPHAN_NODE_COLOR ]
            [ -s EDGE_COLOR ]
            [ -g GSIZE ]
            [ -r RANKSEP ]
            [ -o OUTPUT ]
            [ -S SCREEN_SIZE ]

            Use -W to enable pywal integration.
            Use -D to enable integration with desktop environments.
            Use -i to suppress wallpaper setting.
            All colors may be specified either as
            - a color name (black, darkorange, ...)
            - a value of format #RRGGBB
            - a value of format #RRGGBBAA

Additional customizations can be performed by modifying the script itself.
The code in the script is well-structured (should be).
To discover the customization possibilities, read the man page of ``graphviz``
and ``twopi``, particularly the section on *GRAPH, NODE AND EDGE ATTRIBUTES*.

---------------
Troubleshooting
---------------

If the graph is too large, use ``-r``.
For example, ``-r 0.3`` means that the distance between the concentric circles
of the graph will be 0.3 **inch**.

An alternative method is to use ``-g``.
The format should be the same as the ``twopi`` ``-Gsize`` option. ``7.5,7.5``
for example forces the graph to be not wider nor higher than 7.5 **inches**.
